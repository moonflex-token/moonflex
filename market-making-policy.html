        <h1>Market Making Policy for MoonFlex (MFX)</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 30 November 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Exclusive Market Making Rights</h2>
        <p>MoonFlex reserves the exclusive right to conduct market making activities for its token, MFX. No other parties, individuals, or entities are permitted to engage in market making operations for MFX without explicit written authorization from MoonFlex.</p>

        <h2>2. Definition of Market Making</h2>
        <p>Market making refers to the process of providing liquidity to the market for MFX tokens by continuously buying and selling tokens, thereby setting or influencing the token's market price.</p>

        <h2>3. Prohibition of Unauthorized Market Making</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unauthorized Market Making:</strong> Any attempt to conduct market making activities for MFX without MoonFlex's authorization is strictly prohibited. This includes but is not limited to placing automated buy/sell orders to influence the token's price, liquidity, or trading volume.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring and Enforcement:</strong> MoonFlex actively monitors market activities and reserves the right to take legal action against any unauthorized market makers. This may include reporting to regulatory bodies, legal proceedings, or other actions as deemed necessary by MoonFlex to protect its interests and the integrity of the MFX market.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Authorization Process</h2>
        <p>If you believe you can contribute positively to the MFX market through market making, you may apply for authorization by contacting us at <a href="mailto:luc@moonflex.xyz">luc@moonflex.xyz</a>. Your application will be reviewed based on criteria including but not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Your history with cryptocurrency market making</li>
                <li>Transparency of operations</li>
                <li>Proposed benefits to the MFX ecosystem</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>5. Legal Consequences</h2>
        <p>Engaging in unauthorized market making can lead to legal consequences, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cease and desist orders</li>
            <li>Financial penalties</li>
            <li>Criminal or civil litigation for market manipulation or other illegal activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Consideration of Legal Frameworks</h2>
        <p>While cryptocurrencies like MFX on the XRP Ledger are not traditionally regulated by securities or commodities laws in many jurisdictions, all market making activities should be conducted with awareness of and respect for any applicable local, regional, or international guidelines or voluntary standards related to digital assets and transactions.</p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>MoonFlex does not guarantee that it will authorize any external market makers. The decision to allow market making activities rests solely with MoonFlex to maintain market integrity and protect the interests of its token holders.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
